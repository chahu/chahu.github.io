2018-10-25,Red,V9,29cab1d4d520e032bfd87dfea1f5b62d,1.0,Attempt,wall-boulders,288.8,Do the setters have a running competition between each other to see who can set the worst boulder? If they do﹐ I’d like to nominate my mom to be the new head setter. Actually no﹐ she’d probably be overqualified. I’d like to nominate my garbage can﹐ seeing as how it’s already filled with trash.

Just like all of you﹐ nothing gives me more of a half chub than watching him clean up every new set but enough is enough﹐ said Bryce this week. Not on my watch. Is there a word for half chub in Japanese?

Does he actually climb any of the problems he sets or does he just stand there﹐ flex his biceps﹐ and call it a day. Someone comment his gamer ID so I can smoke him in Fortnite.
2018-10-19,Tan,V8,04520fa710054d5441ae5b1c1d9f5dbf,1.0,Attempt,wall-boulders,505.7,If the FBI got into climbing﹐ they should hire Bo Durham to set boulders like this one so they can use it to interrogate national security threats by forcing them to climb it. I can’t think of a better way to physically and mentally torture another human being. This climb might violate some of the Geneva Conventions. 
2018-10-10,Pink,V5,887946b6f486a8ee442affe79db7c73a,1.0,Attempt,wall-boulders,736.4,At first glance﹐ the problem is aesthetically pleasing but after your first attempt﹐ you quickly see the problem for what it truly is. A nauseating monstrosity. The stench of laziness and lack in creativity quickly fills your nostrils as you’re meandering your way up this unnecessarily convoluted mess﹐ only to realize you do not possess the height nor the biceps to have a chance at ever making it to the top of this pink calamity. 
2018-10-10,Black,V6,9270b6aa4e48e3d9caae20969777c045,1.0,Attempt,wall-boulders,736.4,I find this problem offensive and I feel personally attacked. Am i just supposed to teleport myself to the jug? I’d like to have a few words with this “Paul Jung”.
2018-10-09,Yellow,V6,5e8b42541f9318761754f8b7f889164d,1.0,Attempt,wall-boulders,359.0,This eddie guy must be 7 feet tall. Give us a chance here pal! Do you think I am out here spending my hard earn money and precious time just to be shut down by your plastic catastrophe? There is literally no physical way to do this without being 8 feet tall.
2018-10-09,White,V5,e0c9f11309f3689c1773ffa6ea3b0f8a,1.0,Attempt,wall-boulders,288.8,How am I supposed to reach the jug?! I saw some tall guys just static the move! I feel like it would be an easier if you could get to the jug without cutting feet. Maybe make the jug closer to the crimps on the left?
2018-10-09,Lime Green,V5,71d18e2175e01451b820033fd13b6f21,1.0,Attempt,wall-boulders,359.0,Jug seems a bit out of reach but could be a good problem if it wasn’t so reachy. Starting jug and finish jug feel pretty good﹐ just need one or two jugs in between them.
