I have finally reached nirvana﹐ unlocked all my qi﹐ and am living with perfect harmony with what society calls “reality”. I have come back to spread my knowledge and create the first spiritual utopia. Unfortunately before I was able to talk to a single person﹐ I jumped on this climb. The second I established onto the start holds﹐ I not only instantly lost everything I worked so hard to achieve﹐ I now have permanent diarrhea﹐ low testosterone﹐ and just spent my life savings on 6 Supreme bricks. Thanks a lot Eddie.
