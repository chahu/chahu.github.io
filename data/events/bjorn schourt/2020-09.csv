Morbid curiosity takes over and you can’t help but slow down to look and see what carnage my lie ahead. You know it’s going to be bad and yet you still have to look. Except in this example you are the bad accident and all your limbs and scattered across the freeway. This is the worst thing that has happened in 2020 so far but there’s still 3 months left. I have no doubt that Vinny will continue to lower the bar.
