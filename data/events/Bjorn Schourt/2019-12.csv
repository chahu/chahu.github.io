Paintings﹐ sculptures﹐ songs﹐ poems﹐ food﹐ comedy﹐ nature﹐ even language is art. Nothing is devoid of artistic qualities because everything invokes some kind of emotional response. Is it possible for you to experience something and feel absolutely nothing at all? Would one consider the absence of emotion﹐ an emotion﹐ and therefore still consider it art? Would clinical sociopaths describe feeling ‘nothing’ as an emotion or is it simply the lack thereof? Should sociopaths be allowed to set boulders for the public? Food for thought.
