If this is the only V4 offered, it needs to actually be a v4 (indoors scale) or intermediate climbers are going to get crushed. The green v3 kinda-dyno is legit the only intermediate route in the set. "

2020-11-28,Lime Green,V3,cc6edd504260a8be0ced61a595cd32b9,,Red Point,wall-boulders,359.0,"New sets really need to work on difficulty tuning with these more midranged routes (v3-v4), they are most all feeling really sandbagged. There is little available between the super warmup routes and then the hard stuff. "
