2020-11-28,Lime Green,V3,cc6edd504260a8be0ced61a595cd32b9,3.0,Red Point,wall-boulders,359.0,"I found the last move of this way too powerful/ stiff/reachy for the grade. I feel like this would be inaccessible if you were short and climbing v3/4; there is too big a gap in difficulty between this and the easier climbs on this set. That said, the rest of it had nice, enjoyable moves."
